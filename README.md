HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 parallel request benchmark scripts
======================================================

This repository contains the scripts used to test HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP Push
and a few other approaches to fetching large collections of items.

The full description of these tests can be found in [this article](https://evertpot.com/h2-paralellism/).

No set up instruction are given, but if you are interested in reproducing my
results and you're stuck somewhere, contact me!
